## Learning Focus

The development of "VibeVortex" is not just about creating a functional application but also about understanding and applying core Angular concepts and best practices. Here are some of the key learning areas:

### Component-Based Architecture

- **Reusable Components**: Learn to build reusable UI components with Angular that can be utilized across the application, enhancing consistency and reducing redundancy.
  - Examples include custom post, comment, and user profile components.
- **Component Communication**: Explore various methods for component interaction, such as @Input/@Output decorators, services, and event emitters, to manage data flow and actions across components.

### Angular Services and Dependency Injection

- **Singleton Services**: Understand the use of Angular services as singletons to share data and functionalities like user authentication, post management, and notification services across components.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Deep dive into Angular's DI system to decouple component logic from service logic, leading to more maintainable and testable code.

### Reactive Programming with RxJS

- **Observables and Subscriptions**: Master the use of RxJS observables to handle asynchronous data streams, such as real-time updates to the newsfeed or comment section.
- **Operators**: Get hands-on experience with RxJS operators to perform operations like filter, map, and debounceTime on observable streams for efficient data handling.

### State Management

- **NgRx**: Optional exploration of NgRx for state management to understand concepts like actions, reducers, effects, and selectors, providing a single source of truth for the application's state.
  - Learn to manage and track the state of the application in a predictable manner, especially useful for larger applications with complex data flows.

### Routing and Navigation

- **Angular Router**: Utilize Angular's Router to manage navigation between different views and states in the application, enhancing the user experience with seamless page transitions.
- **Route Guards**: Implement route guards to control access to certain parts of the application based on user authentication or authorization levels.

### Performance Optimization

- **Change Detection Strategies**: Implement efficient change detection strategies to optimize application performance, reducing the performance overhead of Angular's default change detection on complex applications.
- **Lazy Loading**: Learn to apply lazy loading for Angular modules to improve initial load times and overall performance by splitting the code into manageable chunks that are loaded on demand.

### Advanced Angular Patterns

- **Content Projection**: Use Angular's content projection to create flexible and reusable components.
- **Dynamic Component Loading**: Explore dynamic component loading to add components programmatically during runtime, useful for dynamic content such as modals or notifications.
